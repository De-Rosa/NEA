## **NEA Project**
AQA A Level Computer Science project created for the NEA (Non-Exam Assessment).  
An environment is created using a rigid-body physics engine, where a bipedal walker attempts to walk across the screen.  
The ML model implemented is PPO (a reinforcement learning algorithm), based on my own matrix library, with Adam being used as the optimization algorithm.
